# Retrospective

  We discussed two topics:

- How to deal with planning and reporting. We felt like the way we're reporting
  at the moment isn't terribly helpful to anyone, but we're not sure how to
  organise things to make it helpful.

  For example, the meeting in Berlin last week threw up a whole load of new
  work. This is good (from our perspective) - it means we understand a lot more,
  we've validated the approach etc. But it also means that a bunch of work has
  seemingly appeared from nowhere.

  Likewise our current milestone is still incomplete, partially due to people
  being away, but also due to the implementation showing issues with the specs,
  for example. This is precisely why we wanted to do it - but how do we convey
  this?

  We spent most of the meeting discussing this topic without coming to any great
  conclusions.

  On the positive side, the team was pretty happy with how the approach
  (spec->implementation) was shaping up in general.
