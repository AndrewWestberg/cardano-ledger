# Lessons learned from last week

- With both this meeting and previous meeting, there was late scheduling and
  this was at a time that Alex couldn't make. We need to schedule these things
  at least a day in advance.
- Starting to implement specs leads to finding out various details we've missed.

# Things to try next week

- Assorted christmas activities
- Rather than having a rigid retrospective format, have a rotating schedule of
  who runs the retrospective and they can change the format. Alex to run the
  next retrospective!
