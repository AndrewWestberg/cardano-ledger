# Summary

# Remarks

- Ru was away all of this week.
- A bunch of time this week was spent debugging a space leak in CI, which was
  preventing us from merging any changes.

# Lessons learned from last week

- Need to keep track of who is around - e.g. Ru was moving to the UK this week,
  and we failed to spot this during the planning.


# Things to try next week

- We work pretty closely with the future spec team; it might make sense to merge
  these (teams and repositories).
- Potentially assign things up front?
- Annotate commits with issue number?
- Variable length milestones?
