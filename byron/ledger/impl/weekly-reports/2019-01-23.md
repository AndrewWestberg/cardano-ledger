# Retrospective

## Some packages which don't compile

cardano-crypto-wrapper isn't compiling - is it being checked during CI?

There are stack.yaml files littered around the place. We need to check with Ru
what the motivation for these is.

We hope that the new nix-tools tooling would solve the issue of defining this in
one place.

## Nix tooling

Recent updates to nix tooling seem to make things more difficult for us to
maintain/understand. What can we do to make sure we retain enough "ownership" of
the build process and avoid it turning into a magic box?

We are going to engage with devops over this and try to make sure things are
elucidated enough.

## Sprints

Have we lost structure?

All working on slightly different things towards different milestones.

Alex finds it maybe easier to get things done using "scrum" like structure?
Marko is finding lack of understanding of what's going on and what we're
planning.

We'll set up a team weekly meeting to increase communication:
- What are we doing?
- What are we about to be doing?

We'll then reevaluate next week and see whether this is working well.
