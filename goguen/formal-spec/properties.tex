\section{Properties of the Goguen Ledger}
\label{sec:properties}

This section collects properties that the ledger described previously is expected to satisfy.

\begin{itemize}
\item The general accounting property holds with any transaction,
  whether it is fully processed or not. This implies that the total
  amount of Ada in the system is constant.
\item If a transaction is accepted and marked as paying fees only
  (i.e. $\fun{txvaltag}\, tx \in \Yes$), then the only change to the ledger
  when processing the transaction is that the inputs marked for paying
  fees are moved to the fee pot.
\item If a Shelley transaction is accepted, it is fully processed.
\item If a transaction extends the UTxO, all its scripts validate, and
  if it has a script that does not validate, it cannot extend the
  UTxO.
\item A valid transaction that does not forge tokens satisfies the
  accounting property of the Shelley ledger where the type $\Coin$ is
  replaced by $\Value$.
\end{itemize}
