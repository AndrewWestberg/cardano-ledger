We list issues found within the Shelley ledger which will be corrected in future eras.

\subsection{Total stake calculation}

As described in \cite[3.4.3]{delegation_design}, stake is sometimes considered
relative to all the delegated stake, and sometimes relative to the
totally supply less the amount held by the reserves.
The former is called active stake, the latter total stake.


The $\fun{createRUpd}$ function from Figure~\ref{fig:rules:reward-update} uses the
current value of the reserve pot, named $\var{reserves}$, to calculate the total stake.
It should, however, use the value of the reserve pot as it was during the previous
epoch, since $\fun{createRUpd}$ is creating the rewards earned during the previous epoch
(see the overview in Section~\ref{sec:reward-overview}).
