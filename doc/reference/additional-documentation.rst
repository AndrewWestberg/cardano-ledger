Additional documentation
------------------------

You can find additional documentation on the nix infrastructure used in
this repo in the following places:

-  `The haskell.nix user
   guide <https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix/blob/documentation/docs/user-guide.md>`__
-  `The nix-tools
   repository <https://github.com/input-output-hk/nix-tools>`__
-  `The iohk-nix
   repository <https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix>`__

Note that the user guide linked above is incomplete and does not
correctly refer to projects built using ``iohk-nix``, as this one is. A
certain amount of trial and error may be required to make substantive
changes!
